/**
 * Process-wide, in-memory source of truth for the active mock session.
 *
 * [MockLocationService] is the only writer: it owns the push loop and the
 * system-level mock provider, independent of any Activity/ViewModel. The UI
 * (through AppViewModel) only ever *reads* this bus and sends commands to the
 * service — it must never derive the session's lifetime from its own
 * lifecycle. Because this is a plain Kotlin singleton scoped to the process,
 * a freshly created ViewModel (e.g. after the Activity was recreated while
 * the foreground service kept the process alive) immediately observes the
 * live session on first collection, which is what makes "reopen the app
 * while mocking" reconnect correctly instead of showing REAL GPS.
